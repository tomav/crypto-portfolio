# crypto-portfolio

This project summarizes your crypto portfolio accross exchanges in a single view.

It is based on the following components:
* `influxdb` as a data storage and visualizer
* `nodejs` for collecting data through exchanges using `ccxt` library
* `docker` for running code and database

## Getting started

### Configuration

Create a `config.json` file based on `config-sample.json` provided in this directory.

#### `influxdb`

* `protocol` to push data to you database, eg:  "https:"
* `hostname` of your influxdb server, eg: "influxdb.domain.com"
* `port` of your server, eg: 443
* `org` is the organization name configured on influxdb **(can be set in docker-compose.yml configuration)**
* `bucket` name where data should be written to **(can be set in docker-compose.yml configuration)**
* `token` used for authentication **(can be set in docker-compose.yml configuration)**

#### `portfolio_config`

* `rate_exchange` is the name of the exchange used to get conversion rates (alt-to-btc and fiat-to-default_fiat_currency), which must match `ccxt` exchanges supported list. Trading paris (for alts and fiat) must exist on this exchange.
* `fiat_currency` is the currency code of your portfolio. 
* `excluded_symbols` is a list of symbol that you want to exclude from your portfolio, can be "credit" tokens like `BTXCRD` on Bittrex or `KFEE` on Kraken.

#### `exchanges`

* `label` is declarative name that will be used to identify an account in influxdb.
* `name` is the actual name of the exchange, which must match `ccxt` exchanges supported list.
* `apiKey` and `secret` are generated by your exchange. Only provide a read-only pair.
* `params` allows to pass additional params to exchange. As you can see in the config sample file, it can be used on the `deribit` example to get `ETH` instead of `BTC`.
